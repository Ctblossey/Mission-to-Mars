# Mission to Mars

## Overview

### Using new tools such as Splinter and BeautifulSoup, we were able to extract NASA data in order to make our analysis about key information. We begain with an extraction of article information, turning the titles and previews into a dictionary. This allowed us to get an understanding of what data scraping is all about.
### Second, we dove into the analytics. We were able to scrape the data into a list and then transform it into a [dataframe](https://github.com/Ctblossey/Mission-to-Mars/blob/main/Mars_Data.csv). From there, we began our analysis. By having the data in a clean table, we extracted metrics such as total days, average minimum temperatures, temperatures by month, pressure by month, and temperature tendencies over the course of all observed days. Scraping data is an important way to stay up to date on your analysis and have a good understanding of trends.
